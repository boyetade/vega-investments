You can click this [link](https://vega-investments.vercel.app/), where you will find the task deployed using the Vercel platform. 

## Things to note:

- For the financial news component, I'm using the free tier of this api which only allows **100** daily api requests, so if there no response it's likely that the allowance has been reached.
- The filter buttons for the overall portfolio balance work but currently require the user to **double click** on the button for the chart to update correctly.
